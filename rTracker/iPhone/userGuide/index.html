            <td  style="vertical-align: top;">
              <ul>
                <li><h3>Getting Started:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Don't try to set up and use everything at once.  Get to know how trackers work before making one private or setting up reminders.</li>
                  <li>You should have an idea of something you want to track, and how the values work - do you know the exact number (car odometer), or is it more fuzzy (how happy am I) so better with a slider?</li>
                  <li>Tap the '+' in the top right corner to add a new tracker</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Name the tracker</li>
                    <li>Add some values to be tracked.  Each value needs a name.  Select the type from the chooser, or just leave it as a number.  Don't worry about the graph color or graph type until you want to change it.</li>
                    <li>Tap 'Save' in the top right corner and get back to the list of trackers.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Use your new tracker.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Tap the name of your tracker in the list.</li>
                    <li>Fill in the values.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the date for the entry if you want by tapping the date at the bottom of the screen.  You're not allowed to set a date in the future.</li>
                    <li>Tap 'Save' in the top right corner to save and return to your list.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Review your tracked data.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Tap the name of your tracker in the list.</li>
                    <li>Turn your device sideways (landscape orientation) to see the graph of your data.  There won't be anything to show until you have saved a few entries.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Tap the left of the screen to cycle through highlighting the different values.</li>
                      <li>Tap a point on the graph to go to that date when you rotate back to portrait orientation.</li>
                      <li>Turn your device back to portrait orientation to return to the tracker.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Swipe right to go to previous entries, left to go to future entries.</li>
                    <li>Use the calendar icon at the bottom of the screen to see dates with data.  Tap a date to go to that day's first entry.  You will have to swipe left to get to later entries on that day.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li><h3>Instructions:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Instructions for each operation are <a href="../QandA/index.html">here</a>.  Many of the screenshots are from older versions, but the controls are the same; this is because it takes a long time to capture screenshots, annotate them, and put them on the web.  If you would like to <a href="https://github.com/rob-miller/rTracker">help</a>, you are welcome to do so.</li>
                  <li>A web-based, clickable walk-through is <a href="../walkthrough/index.html">here</a>.  Again, the images are out of date; see above.  Any blue circle is a link that will take you to a screenshot of the app as if you tapped the relevant button in the app.  This does not cover all of the features of rTracker, just the basic usage.</li>
